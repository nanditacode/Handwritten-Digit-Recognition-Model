# MNIST
This model uses MNIST dataset to recognize handwriting.

Firstly I have downloaded the MNIST dataset and then I have showed the difference in accuracy without using hidden layer and with using hidden layers. 
I have run this model for 5 Epochs. 
The accuracy got improved with using the hidden layer. By adding more hidden layers, the accuracy could be improved further more.
